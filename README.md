# Supervised Machine Learning Project

This notebook is my project for a Supervised Machine Learning course at CU Boulder.

weather_prediction_project.ipynb is the entire project and it includes comparing various models to predict weather based on inputs such as precipitation, max temperature, min temperature, and wind.
